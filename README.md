## A little story about Double Feature

Double Feature was born as a Windows application, built in C# and .Net Framework, in 2010. Developing a Windows app was frustrating sometimes, mostly because of my short expertise back then. After a few versions, I abandoned the project for personal reasons, but I always had the feeling that DF could be a better app than it was in its last version. Now, thanks to node-webkit, I'm building a brand new Double Feature from scratch, creating a cross-platform app for Windows and Mac users (and Linux users, maybe), and focusing in what it matters: Creating new features and improving the existing ones.
